MEDICARE CLAIMS DATA


BENEFICIARY SUMMARY
- There are some challenges identifying the target variables for this
- Claims are on an aggregated level (not necessarily case by case)
- Target Variable can be engineered as a denial if outpatient disbursement amounts are all zero
- But again its a patients annual summary

CMS Inpatient Claims/ Outpatient claims
- Claim payment amount - if 0 we can classify it as denied.

    - Claim Adjustment
    - Claim Denial or Rejection ***
    - Claim Adjustment


ML - Model vs LLM:
- OpenAI API results are a random guess, mutliple tweaks to one test observations give different results
- Used randomforestclassifier to train the data set for prediction
- The next goal is to tune the xgboost 
- Transformer based networks like TabNet FT-Transformer
- Convert your tabular data into a text-based format for fine tuning
